in airforce, no position, he goes into real estate, hot day, car breaks down.  He decides to tinker with it (dad and guy).  Car blows up.  Dad dies in the fires of hell.  Son is rushed to hospital with blindness and 3rd degree burns and nub hands.   He is treated with acid baths and other shitty stuff.  Everything hurts and he has constant pain.  He wants to die from the getgo.  From the second he is burned until the entire time.  He says please kill me.  His mom signs consent forms to have procedures for him to live and the doctors listen to his mom.  The doctors keep him alive and keep doing painful procedures.  He gets declared sane by psychiatrists and says he wants to die.  But they don't wanna b/c they feel like they are playing god by killing him.  


While the case of Dax is certainly a complex and unfortunate situation, many moral judgements can be made about what occurred.  It is difficult to say what the best approach would have been, but it cannot be argued that the final outcome is negative. Dax's journey was a long, painful, and arduous, and at times, he yearned for death and was denied such release.
